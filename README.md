## Key Lessons Learned About Clean Code

- **Readability Matters**: Writing code that others (and my future self) can understand easily is essential. Proper naming conventions, structure, and comments can make a big difference.
- **Avoid Redundancy**: Keeping code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is vital for maintainability and efficiency.
- **Consistent Style**: Following a consistent coding style, such as indentation and spacing, improves the readability and professionalism of the code.
