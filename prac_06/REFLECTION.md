# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I’ve shifted focus toward better understanding OOP principles, which has helped me create more modular and reusable code. This is evident in my recent use of classes and instances in practical exercises. This change has improved the structure and readability of my programs.

## 

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to improve my time management, giving myself more time to thoroughly test and refine my code. Additionally, I should work on error-handling skills to make my programs more resilient. Taking a more systematic approach to debugging would also help reduce wasted time.

## 

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I’ve been effective at breaking down tasks into manageable steps, which helps me stay focused and productive. My emphasis on modular code improves readability and functionality. I plan to continue this approach in future assignments.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop rushing through instructions and take time to fully understand requirements before starting. This will help prevent unnecessary mistakes and rewrites. Additionally, I should move away from trial-and-error debugging by analyzing issues more systematically.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

More real-world examples and case studies would be helpful to see how programming concepts are used in practice. Projects that integrate multiple concepts could enhance our understanding. This would make the subject more applicable to industry situations.
